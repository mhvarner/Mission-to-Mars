# Mission-to-Mars
Developing a website scraping data from Nasa's website which includes pictures and info about the planet Mars. For the challenge, I created a loop from which I used a similar structure as the module work and was able to render the four Mars hemispheres using the bootstrap syntax. This made it unnecessary to create an app route for the hemispheres as the previous routes already created encapsulated the loop that was created for the hemisphere implementation into the website. I was also able to add in a few alerts("<div class="alert-alert info" role="alert></div>"), random facts ("p/p" structure with a "footer/footer" added), and a dropdown where the user of the website can pick among the four hemispheres as to what they thought their favorite was in order to make it more interactive (I utilized the "select/select" structure). I also was able to add a picture I scraped from the Nasa website and put it in my .jumbotron area where the "head" section is.

***For the readme, it would not allow me to post the <> in front of each part of the index.html so I just quoted each structure. Also the wesbite https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars has been acting up lately and sometimes does not render everything due to it being down. When the website is up and running, everything renders perfectly on mine, just an FYI. At the bottom of the Readme, that picture is just showing the interactive dropdown I incorporated. I run everything through the newest version of Safari, I rarely use Chrome, so while there should not be any changes between the two when it comes to the index.html file, this is just a heads up in case something does not render correctly, as Safari is my primary (default) engine.
